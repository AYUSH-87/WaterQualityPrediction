# ðŸ’§ Water Quality Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict the quality of water based on various chemical and physical parameters. It helps in identifying whether the water sample is safe for consumption or not.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
  
- `pollution_model.pkl` â€“ Trained ML model (downloadable from Google Drive)  
- `notebooks/` â€“ Jupyter notebooks for model training and evaluation  
- `data/` â€“ Dataset used for model development  
- `requirements.txt` â€“ Python dependencies

## ðŸš€ Features

- Takes real-world water quality parameters as input  
- Predicts potability: **Safe** or **Not Safe**  
- Clean and interactive Streamlit web interface  
- Model trained using decision tree/classification algorithm
